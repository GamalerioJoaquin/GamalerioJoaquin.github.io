## Projects
### •Effect of non-random dilution in Deep Learning with Feed-Forward Neural Networks
 _Degree thesis directed by Francisco A. Tamarit_

- In this thesis project to qualify for the Bachelor’s Degree in Physics, I explore the effect of non-random diluted
feed-forward neural networks using variations of the Dropout and Drop-Connect methods.

### •Deciphering the Universe: Appearance of Galaxies

- In this project, we seek to classify the morphological type of galaxies through their physical properties and the
visual appearance that distinguishes each type, using Machine Learning models and tools.
