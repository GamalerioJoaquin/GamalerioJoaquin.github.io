## About me 

I am an advanced undergraduate student pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Physics with a profound aspiration to become a Data Scientist. My passion extends to Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and the diverse applications of Artificial Intelligence. Since childhood, I have harbored an insatiable curiosity for learning new things, a trait that persists to this day. I am genuinely excited about continuing to expand my knowledge in this domain and taking on new challenges.

## Education

 - Licenciatura en Física | National University of Cordoba | (2017-present)		
  
 
 - Data Science Diploma | National University of Cordoba | (2023)



             		
## Work Experience

**Students Tutor @ Facultad de Matematica, Fisica y Astronomia, UNC (From March to August 2022 )**
- I provided academic and extra-academic support to first-year students of Facultad de Matemática, Astronomía,
  Física y Computación during the first half of 2022.
- The program was promoted by Student Affairs Secretary (SAE).

**Personal Teacher (2019 - Present)**
- I provide private support classes to students who are working on university, high school or college subjects.
- The subjects taught are Physics and Mathematics.

## Projects
### •Effect of non-random dilution in Deep Learning with Feed-Forward Neural Networks
 _Degree thesis directed by Francisco A. Tamarit_

[Link to repository available soon]

- In this thesis project to qualify for the Bachelor’s Degree in Physics, I explore the effect of non-random diluted
feed-forward neural networks using variations of the Dropout and Drop-Connect methods.

### •Morphological Classification of Galaxies

[Link to repository](https://github.com/GamalerioJoaquin/Morphological-Classification-of-Galaxies)

- In this project, we seek to classify the morphological type of galaxies through their physical properties and the
visual appearance that distinguishes each type, using Machine Learning models and tools.
